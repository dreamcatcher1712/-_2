This project analyzed unemployment in India, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown. The following graphs were plotted:

A histogram of unemployment rates by region and state
A sunburst chart of unemployment rates by state within each region
A bar chart comparing the unemployment rate and labor participation rate over time
A box plot comparing the unemployment rate by state
An animated bar chart showing the unemployment rate by state over time
A scatter geo plot showing the unemployment rate by state and region

The project's findings are that the unemployment rate is highest in the North-East and Central regions of India. The project also found that the unemployment rate increased sharply during the COVID-19 lockdown and that it increased in all states after the lockdown.
